### INTRODUCTION

This demo project features a NBA relevant application that includes an interface that displays relevant stats for a given player during the 2022-2023 season.
All stats can be sorted by increasing or decreasing order according to preference.
Some game details are displayed for each stats.

For a given player we can now easily find games where a performance metric was at its highest or lowest and use it as a starting point for further analysis.

### HOW TO USE
#### Player Search
Search for a player by typing his last name, for example:

- `doncic` will return `Luka Doncic`
- `don` will return all players with a last name that contains `don`

#### Player Statistics
Player stats are displayed per game, from most recent to oldest. All stats can be sorted so that you can easily compare and find lows and highs for each.

Stats are displayed in table format for better visualization and interaction.
All results are paginated for improved readability.

### BUILT WITH

- vitejs, reactjs, typescript, javascript, css, html

### FUTURE TODOs

Additional features to work on if there was more time or resources.
Includes ideas to improve this project and issues regarding performance, bugs, etc.

#### Features:
- for the scope of the demo, the season was set to "2022" for the 22-23 NBA season
  - allow user to select between season for comparison purposes
- further features to allow more in-depth analysis in this player analysis model:
  - allow users to compare different players against each other
  - allow users to compare player vs team
  - allow users to compare player vs other similar players
#### Data:
- a significant blocker for this project was data access and lack of knowledge of existing tools in the world of basketball, as rapidApi has a free tier fo data exploration that was use for the scope of this demo project, but that has significant drawbacks if used for professional competitive applications (cost, downtime, stale data, etc)
  - further research data sources
  - build web crawler for specific types of data
  - build a backend to access espn/nba/etc. data that is updated
  - collaborate with data analytics team to research pertinent data sources and assess data relevancy
#### Backend:
- build a full backend to allow auth, data management with databases, fetch data from APIs and store & manipulate data
#### Authentication:
- add auth to allow userâ€™s to add comments, save/share data, collaborate
#### UI / display:
- improve table horizontal scroll without compressing data on smaller screens
#### UX:
- add navigation items to the navbar
  - currently navbar displays teams but does not navigate anywhere
  - future versions could navigate to teams > players | team data & stats
  - allow users to add notes or to flag certain stats/games/players
#### Performance:
- code split and lazy loading to reduce load times
  - started lazy load in the routes
  - further destructure components to optimize performance
#### Site Reliability:
- further testing for Q&A
- elegantly handle API / data fetch errors
    - RapidApi `NBA-API` has missing data
    *example*: no team and season data for Isaiah Thomas
