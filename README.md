- `don` will return all players with a last name that contains `don`

#### Player Statistics
Player stats are displayed per game, from most recent to oldest. All stats can be sorted so that you can easily compare and find lows and highs for each.

### FUTURE TODOs

Additional features to work on if there was more time or resources

- Backend:

- Authentication:
    - add auth to allow userâ€™s to add comments, save/share data, collaborate
- UI / display:
    - improve table horizontal scroll without compressing data on smaller screens
- Site Reliability:
    - further testing for Q&A
    - elegantly handle API / data fetch errors
        - RapidApi `NBA-API` has missing data
        *example*: no 2022 team and season data for Isaiah Thomas
