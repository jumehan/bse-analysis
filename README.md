### INTRODUCTION

### HOW TO USE
#### Player Search
Search for a player by typing his last name, for example:

- `doncic` will return `Luka Doncic`
- `don` will return all players with a last name that contains `don`

#### Player Statistics
Player stats are displayed per game, from most recent to oldest. All stats can be sorted so that you can easily compare and find lows and highs for each.

Stats are displayed in table format for better visualization and interaction.
All results are paginated for improved readability.

### BUILT WITH

- vitejs, reactjs, typescript, javascript, css, html

### FUTURE TODOs

Additional features to work on if there was more time or resources

#### Backend:
- building a full backend to allow auth, data management with databases, fetch data from APIs and store & manipulate data
#### Authentication:
- add auth to allow userâ€™s to add comments, save/share data, collaborate
#### UI / display:
- improve table horizontal scroll without compressing data on smaller screens
#### UX:
- add navigation items to the navbar
  - currently navbar displays teams but does not navigate anywhere
  - future versions could navigate to teams > players | team data & stats
#### Site Reliability:
- further testing for Q&A
- elegantly handle API / data fetch errors
    - RapidApi `NBA-API` has missing data
    *example*: no 2022 team and season data for Isaiah Thomas
-

### SETUP
